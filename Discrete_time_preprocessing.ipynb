    "    4. Create m parameter-cuts of the data as equidistant\n",
    "    5. Implement an event-sorting algorithm based on the cuts and events.\n",
    "    6. Finish processing the data so its ready for training\n",
    "    7. Setup a network alongside the binary-cross-loss (sigmoid on the network output).\n",
    "    8. Implement a function to create survival function for the chosen slices (0, m)\n",
    "    9. Plot survival for five individuals\n",
    "    10. plot accuracy\n",
    "    11. attempt C-index or Brier score on the network outputs."
